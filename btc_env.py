"""BTC trading environment. Trains on BTC price history to learn to buy/sell/hold.

This is an environment tailored towards TensorForce, not OpenAI Gym. Gym environments are
a standard used by many projects (Baselines, Coach, etc) and so would make sense to use; and TForce is compatible with
Gym envs. It's just that there's hoops to go through converting a Gym env to TForce, and it was ugly code. I actually
had it that way, you can search through Git if you want the Gym env; but one day I decided "I'm not having success with
any of these other projects, TForce is the best - I'm just gonna stick to that" and this approach was cleaner.

I actually do want to try NervanaSystems/Coach, that one's new since I started developing. Will require converting this
env back to Gym format. Anyone wanna give it a go?

        Some special handling of the price data. First, we don't want prices to be absolute, since we wan't the agent
        to learn actions _relative_ to states; that is, states need to be transformed into "relative" some how. This
        is called "stationary time series"; they fluctuate around y=0, like visualizing audio rather than a line graph.
        Next, we don't want absolute price changes, since that's still not relative enough (prices change in larger
        amounts when the BTC price is already large - we want to learn the pattern, not the numbers). So the solution
        is percent-changes. Now - making everything a percent-change from its past makes it so you can track that
        field's history, but you lose how it relates to the other fields in its cross-section. So here's what we do.
        Anchor all the price fields to the target (close-price); so they're relative w/i the cross-section. Then set
        target to its percent-change over time. Leave the volume stuff alone, we _do_ want that absolute. Then scale
        everything. Crazy, I know; but IMO makes sense. Hit me if you have a better idea.
